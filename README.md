# DOJ CRT Portal

This was for a prototype of [civilrights.justice.gov] for the current codebase at: https://github.com/usdoj-crt/crt-portal 

A Civil Rights complaints portal prototype built using the Acquia [BLT](https://github.com/acquia/blt) Drupal stack. BLT is a template and tool for building, testing, and deploying Drupal from Acquia.

# Acquia Cloud and git setup

1. Request access to the Acquia Cloud Environment for your project (if needed).

2. Setup a SSH key that can be used for GitHub and the Acquia Cloud (you CAN use the same key).
    1. [Setup GitHub SSH Keys](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/)
    2. [Setup Acquia Cloud SSH Keys](https://docs.acquia.com/acquia-cloud/ssh/generate)

3. Clone this repository. By default, Git names this "origin" on your local machine.

```
git clone git@github.com:usdoj/crt-portal.git
```

# Local Environment Setup

#### 1. Install VM dependencies

Running your local environment requires VirtualBox and Vagrant. Install both locally:

- https://www.virtualbox.org/
- https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html

If the VirtualBox installation process ends with an error screen on MacOS, you may need to follow [these obscure steps](https://ilgthegeek.wordpress.com/2018/01/27/macos-install-oracle-virtualbox-on-10-13/) and try re-installing.

#### 2. Install php and Composer

Install php if you don't already have it on your machine:

- https://php.net/

Download Composer:

- https://getcomposer.org/download/

You may have to take additional steps to make composer available anywhere in your Terminal, such as:

```
mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer
```

See https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md for more information.

You should be able to run composer from the root directory of this project and see a list of composer commands.

#### 3. Install Composer dependencies locally

From the root directory of this project:

```
composer install
```

#### 4. Setup a local blt alias

Add the following to your `~/.bash_profile` or equivalent to create a local alias to the `blt` tool:

```
function blt() {
  if [[ ! -z ${AH_SITE_ENVIRONMENT} ]]; then
    PROJECT_ROOT="/var/www/html/${AH_SITE_GROUP}.${AH_SITE_ENVIRONMENT}"
  elif [ "`git rev-parse --show-cdup 2> /dev/null`" != "" ]; then
    PROJECT_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-cdup)
  else
    PROJECT_ROOT="."
  fi

  if [ -f "$PROJECT_ROOT/vendor/bin/blt" ]; then
    $PROJECT_ROOT/vendor/bin/blt "$@"

  # Check for local BLT.
  elif [ -f "./vendor/bin/blt" ]; then
    ./vendor/bin/blt "$@"

  else
    echo "You must run this command from within a BLT-generated project."
    return 1
  fi
}

```

#### 5. Install DrupalVM setup using blt vm

```
blt vm
```

#### 6. Setup VM

Setup the VM with the configuration from this repositories [configuration files](#important-configuration-files).

```
vagrant up
```

This task may fail with the following error:

```
pip: command not found
```

You will need to fix this by logging into the box and installing pip and ansible manually:

```
vagrant ssh
sudo apt install python-pip
pip install --upgrade ansible
```

If `vagrant up` did not run successfully, you may need to run:

```
vagrant reload --provision
```

#### 7. Check vagrant status

See the status of your virtual machines:

```
vagrant global-status
```

You should see a row with "name" equal to "dojportal-blt" and "state" equal to "running."

## ... I want to visit my site locally

http://local.dojportal-blt.com/

If you don't see anything, check your `/etc/hosts` file or adjust the port forwarding settings in your `Vagrantfile`.

## ... I want to run drush commands against Acquia Cloud sites

Follow the "Acquia Cloud aliases" instructions on https://docs.acquia.com/blt/developer/drush/:

> You can download aliases for Acquia Cloud sites by signing in to https://cloud.acquia.com, and then going to the Credentials tab on your user profile. Download and place the relevant alias file into drush/sites.

Cheeck to see if your drush aliases are set up correctly:

```
drush sa
```

### Troubleshooting Drush/BLT commands

When you run into set up errors, using the `--verbose` flag can give valuable info for debugging

## ... I want to set up a new Drupal site

After you've completed steps 1 through 6 above:

#### 1. SSH into your VM

```
vagrant ssh
```

#### 2. Set up blt alias within the VM

```
composer run-script blt-alias
```

#### 3. Setup a local Drupal site with an empty database.
Use BLT to setup the site with configuration.  If it is a multisite you can identify a specific site.

```
blt setup
```
or

```
blt setup --site=[sitename]
```

#### 4. Log into your site with drush

Log into the VM and run the following commands within your VM:

```
cd docroot
drush uli
```

## ... I want to import configuration locally

First, download the configuration you want to import to `config/default`. (Or switch to a branch which contains the configuration you need in `config/default`.)

Make sure your drush config is set to match the UUID of the Drupal site you would like to import from. In the case of our app, use:

```
# from within vagrant ssh

drush config-set "system.site" uuid "3bb8cee4-7729-4ef8-acb0-46ca31a0d55d"
```

Once the UUID matches, you should be able to run:

```
# from within vagrant ssh

drush cim
```

## ... I want to customize the project theme

This project uses the [Drupal USWDS base theme](https://www.drupal.org/project/uswds). Its active theme is a subtheme called `crt_portal_subtheme`.

To customize the subtheme using Sass, edit the `_variables.scss` and `uswds.scss` override files in the `crt_portal_subtheme` folder, and then regenerate the CSS:

```
cd docroot/themes/custom/crt_portal_subtheme/
npm install
cp -r node_modules/uswds/dist assets
npm run build
```

Or use "watch" mode to regenerate the CSS whenever the Sass is edited:

```
...
npm run build:watch
```

## Other BLT Steps

#### Pull Files locally.
Use BLT to pull all files down from your Cloud environment.

```
blt drupal:sync:files
```

#### Sync the Cloud Database.
If you have an existing database you can use BLT to pull down the database from your Cloud environment.

```
blt sync
```

# Deploy

```
blt artifact:deploy --commit-msg "Commit message here." --branch "branch name here" --no-interaction
```

Most likely, when deploying, you will need to make changes that also affect the database, since Drupal saves configuration in the database. For those kinds of changes, you will also need to run drush commands.

Here is an example of runnning that on dev after a successful deploy:

Import the configuration from the files with:
```
drush @dojportal-blt.dev cim
```

Rebuild the cashe with drush
```
drush @dojportal-blt.dev cr
```

To make sure you see changes, also go to the dashboard and clear varnish.


## Installing, deploying, and enabling a new module

1. Install and enable the module locally
2. Export configuration locally (eg, `drush @dojportal-blt.local cex`)
3. Commit the exported configuration
4. Deploy to Acquia (see deploy commands above)
5. Import the configuration to Acquia (eg, `drush @dojportal-blt.dev cim`)
6. When you have a choice to use "sync" or "vcs", choose "vcs".

## Working With a BLT Project

BLT projects are designed to instill software development best practices (including git workflows).

Our BLT Developer documentation includes an [example workflow](https://docs.acquia.com/blt/developer/dev-workflow/).

### Important Configuration Files

BLT uses a number of configuration (`.yml` or `.json`) files to define and customize behaviors. Some examples of these are:

* `blt/blt.yml` (formerly blt/project.yml prior to BLT 9.x)
* `blt/local.blt.yml` (local only specific blt configuration)
* `box/config.yml` (if using Drupal VM)
* `drush/sites` (contains Drush aliases for this project)
* `composer.json` (includes required components, including Drupal Modules, for this project)
